# Continuity Dashboard

A visual network graph interface for exploring canonical relationships in The Forgotten Tides Universe.

## Overview

The Continuity Dashboard is a web-based tool that visualizes the `REFERENCE_MAP.json` file as an interactive network graph. It provides a high-level view of how characters, locations, mechanics, factions, and stories are interconnected within the universe.

This dashboard implements **Phase 7** of the Structural Audit & Optimization Plan.

## Features

- 📊 **Interactive Network Graph**: Visualize all entities and their relationships
- 🎨 **Color-Coded Nodes**: Different colors for each entity type
- 🔍 **Filtering**: Show/hide entity types to focus on specific relationships
- 📝 **Node Details**: Click on any node to see detailed information
- 🔎 **Zoom & Pan**: Navigate large graphs with mouse controls
- 🔄 **Live Updates**: Reload button to refresh data without page reload
- ⚠️ **Missing Node Detection**: Highlights speculative or missing entities

## Entity Types & Colors

| Type | Color | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Character** | 🔵 Blue (#4a9eff) | Character entities |
| **Location** | 🔴 Red (#ff6b6b) | Physical locations |
| **Mechanics** | 🟢 Green (#51cf66) | Physics/mechanics rules |
| **Faction** | 🟡 Yellow (#ffd93d) | Political/cultural groups |
| **Story** | 🟣 Purple (#a78bfa) | Published stories |
| **Missing** | ⚪ Gray (50% opacity) | Speculative or missing nodes |

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **From the repository root**, start a local web server:
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8080
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/dashboard/
   ```

3. The dashboard will automatically load `REFERENCE_MAP.json` from the repository root.

### Alternative: Using npm scripts

Add this to your workflow by adding an npm script in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dashboard": "npx http-server -p 8080 -o /dashboard/"
  }
}
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run dashboard
```

### Controls

- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Click & Drag**: Pan the view
- **Click Node**: Show node details in the info panel
- **Filter Checkboxes**: Toggle visibility of entity types
- **Reset View**: Fit all visible nodes into the viewport
- **Reload Data**: Refresh the dashboard with latest REFERENCE_MAP.json

## Data Structure

The dashboard reads from `REFERENCE_MAP.json` in the repository root. Expected structure:

```json
{
  "generated": "2025-12-12T00:00:00Z",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "canonical_id": "char-0001",
      "type": "character",
      "name": "Rell",
      "path": "characters/Rell.md",
      "status": "canonical"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "char-0001",
      "to": "char-0002",
      "type": "characters"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Node Properties

- `canonical_id` (required): Unique identifier
- `type` (required): Entity type (character, location, mechanics, faction, story)
- `name` (required): Display name
- `path` (optional): File path in repository
- `status` (optional): "canonical", "speculative", or "missing"

### Edge Properties

- `from` (required): Source canonical_id
- `to` (required): Target canonical_id
- `type` (required): Relationship type

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

- **vis-network**: Network graph visualization library (loaded via CDN)
- No build process required - pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

### Browser Requirements

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- JavaScript must be enabled
- Fetch API support (all modern browsers)

### File Structure

```
dashboard/
├── index.html      # Main HTML file with styles
├── dashboard.js    # Dashboard logic and graph rendering
└── README.md       # This file
```

### Physics Simulation

The graph uses a force-directed layout with the following parameters:
- **Gravitational Constant**: -50 (nodes repel each other)
- **Spring Length**: 150px (preferred distance between connected nodes)
- **Spring Constant**: 0.08 (edge stiffness)
- **Damping**: 0.4 (motion decay)

The physics simulation runs for 200 iterations on initial load, then disables for better performance.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load REFERENCE_MAP.json"

**Problem**: The dashboard can't find or load the reference map file.

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure you're running a local web server (not opening `index.html` directly)
2. Verify `REFERENCE_MAP.json` exists in the repository root
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Graph is Empty

**Problem**: No nodes or edges are visible.

**Solutions**:
1. Check that all filter checkboxes are enabled
2. Verify `REFERENCE_MAP.json` has valid `nodes` and `edges` arrays
3. Click "Reset View" to fit the graph in the viewport

### Graph is Too Crowded

**Problem**: Too many nodes make the graph difficult to read.

**Solutions**:
1. Use filter checkboxes to hide entity types you're not interested in
2. Zoom in on specific clusters
3. Click individual nodes to see their details

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Graph is slow or unresponsive with many nodes.

**Solutions**:
1. Filter out entity types to reduce visible nodes
2. Disable physics after initial layout (done automatically)
3. Close the browser's developer tools
4. Use a modern browser with hardware acceleration

## Development

### Adding New Features

To extend the dashboard:

1. **Add new entity types**: Update `typeColors` object in `dashboard.js`
2. **Modify physics**: Adjust parameters in the `options.physics` section
3. **Change styling**: Edit the `<style>` section in `index.html`
4. **Add new controls**: Add HTML elements and wire up event listeners

### Updating the Reference Map

The dashboard automatically reflects changes to `REFERENCE_MAP.json`. To update:

1. Modify `REFERENCE_MAP.json` in the repository root
2. Click "Reload Data" button in the dashboard
3. Or refresh the page

### Integration with CI/CD

The dashboard can be integrated into GitHub Actions or other CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example: Deploy dashboard to GitHub Pages
- name: Deploy Dashboard
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: ./dashboard
    keep_files: true
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- [ ] Search functionality to find specific entities
- [ ] Path highlighting to show connections between two nodes
- [ ] Export graph as image (PNG/SVG)
- [ ] Timeline view for temporal relationships
- [ ] Diff view to compare reference maps over time
- [ ] Integration with validation reports
- [ ] Custom layout algorithms (hierarchical, circular, etc.)
- [ ] Node grouping by entity type
- [ ] Edge filtering by relationship type
