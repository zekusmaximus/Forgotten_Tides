# Tari
Archivist Novice, Heliodrome Survivor  
Continuity Profile: ARCH-CHLD-047-T

Tari is a young boy with unusually precise memory sensitivity—capable of feeling the mnemonic weight of objects and people. His presence serves as a mirror for the crew’s sacrifices.

# 1. Physiological & Cognitive Profile

- Species: Human  
- Age: Approximately 11–13  
- Physiology: slight frame, mild drift exposure  
- Cognitive Features:
  - acute sensitivity to memory density  
  - early-stage reliquary resonance detection  
  - empathic intuition bordering on precognitive perception  

He is likely a nascent reliquarist or memory-cartographer.

---

# 2. Memory Profile

Tari carries:
- strong familial anchors  
- particularly vivid memory of his father’s archive  
- unique ability to assess the “safety” of memories as navigation fuel  

His grasp of mnemonic ethics is intuitive, not doctrinal.

---

# 3. Family Context

Tari’s father suffers from a degenerative memory condition.

Consequences:
- home environment exhibits micro-drift  
- Tari developed heightened memory vigilance early  
- remains hyper-aware of anchor fragility  

This created both trauma and exceptional talent.

# 4. Relationship to the Crew

### Rell
- admires him  
- fears becoming like him  
- senses Rell’s emptiness after the final anchor-burn  

Tari’s offer—“Use the copy”—reveals both bravery and a child’s dangerous willingness to sacrifice.

### Sutira
- protective, quiet affection  
- sees the boy as an emblem of what civilization must preserve  

### Estavan
- gentle mentorship  
- sees him as a future archivist  
- introduces him to reliquary mechanics informally

# 5. Abilities and Potential

Tari is a **memory-sensitive phenotype**, rare but significant.

Potential roles:
- reliquary tuner  
- corridor resonance scout  
- memory-cartographer  
- Solace monk  
- archivist-navigator hybrid (extremely rare)

His perception of memory “temperature” allows him to identify overcharged civic stones or unsafe emotional memories.

---

# 6. Psychological and Emotional State

Post-Heliodrome:
- displays survivor’s guilt  
- heightened empathy for anchor-burn victims  
- mild nightmares involving corridor thinning  
- determination to learn memory ethics correctly  

He is resilient, but shaped by trauma.

---

# 7. Narrative Function

Tari provides:
- contrast to Rell’s self-erasure  
- moral clarity about what memory should be used for  
- future potential for navigating memory-driven universes  

He represents what the universe is fighting to preserve:  
**a future with enough innocence to still remember gently.**
