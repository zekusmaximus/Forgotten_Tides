THE ARCHIVIST’S WAKE

I. Mouth of the Corridor
The corridor puckered two minutes into the run—glass one heartbeat, wrinkled membrane the next. Rails thrummed. A boy’s hand slid through the safety web as if the mesh had forgotten solidity.
“Third deck—now,” Captain Sutira snapped, unhooking her harness.
But the boy was half-ghost where the corridor’s mouth thinned. The drive keened for weight—raw need sharpened into sound.
Chief Estavan planted a palm by my chair. No words. Rell was implied.
“I’m on it.” I tightened the rib-girdle until breath came in narrow increments. The sensorium ring kissed my skull, cold flickering down my spine.
The corridor responds to attention. When it loses yours, it loses itself.
Sutira lunged for the boy; her fingers slipped through his sleeve where fabric had stopped being fabric. “Hold him!”
“Hold the corridor,” I said, unclipping the safety lead.
“Rell—”
I ignored her and spliced the drive to my belt with a contraband jumper coil. Zero-anchor: the banned pinch. Feed it not curated memory but your own presence, concentrated to a point. Dangerous. Effective.
“Do it,” Sutira said quietly. A blessing disguised as permission.
I exhaled to the bottom of my ribs and pressed the clamp.
Pain detonated in my teeth—tinfoil lightning. The corridor snapped into focus. The boy’s sleeve remembered thread. Sutira yanked hard; he fell into her arms, screaming. Screaming meant density. Good.
The drive purred, chastened. Then the loss surfaced.
A blank notch in my mind—smooth as sanded bone. I checked my fingers, ran through my anchor knots. Sixteen lived. One—Sutira’s double-hitch—did not.
“What did it take?” Estavan asked softly.
“Nothing I need.” A lie with steady hands.
The corridor sealed behind us. The ship’s hum eased into its working rhythm.
II. The Weight Ledger
The galley stank of broth thick as grease. Archivists clustered at the long table in layered sleeves and reliquaries. Their cargo hummed—memory under pressure. Tari, the boy, sat wrapped in a blanket, gripping an empty wooden box like it held warmth.
Salt steadied me. The missing knot pulsed at the edge of awareness.
Estavan slumped across from me. “You’re banned from zero-anchoring.”
“Planning to stop me?”
“Yes. With Sutira.” His deadpan landed.
“She’d do it,” I said.
“She would,” he agreed. “And she’d be right. Keep pushing that trick and you’ll forget nouns. Then faces. Then your own name.”
Sutira swept in, hair damp. She dropped a tablet onto the table. It showed the Lattice Gap, the waveforms jagged and terrified.
“Heliodrome’s song is off pitch,” she said.
I pulled the tablet closer. The telemetry wasn't just drifting; it was unraveling. “Eight degrees of shear?”
“And widening,” she said.
“That’s not drift,” I said. “That’s dementia. The station doesn’t know what a floor is anymore.”
“If it hits ten degrees, the whole place comes apart conceptually,” Sutira said. “We have three pulls to reach them. Corridor’s already soft.”
She looked at me. “Your objective is simple, Rell—get us there without hollowing passengers.”
My hand brushed the illegal cache stone in my jacket. My one preserved memory. The last piece of myself I’d refused to spend.
“I’ll do it,” I said.
III. Birch in the Void
The Lattice Gap felt sterile—less a place than the absence of one. We hit turbulence fast.
“Corridor thinning,” Estavan said. “Drive wants weight.”
Tari appeared, barefoot, clasping the wooden box. “Use the copy,” he said. “My father’s archive. Take it.”
His fear was precise, aimed.
I shook my head. “Civic memories run hot. They’ll oversteer us. We need something smaller.”
My gaze caught a reliquary stone labeled FIRST GARDEN: BIRCH.
A personal memory. Textured. Stable.
The archivist carrying it—older, tired—unstrapped it without protest and placed it in my palm. “Be kind,” they murmured.
I slotted it.
Warmth rose in the sensorium: rooftop dirt, cheap ceramic, a sapling tended after funerals. Ordinary, stubborn life. The corridor steadied. Rails stopped trembling. We rode the birch’s memory—small roots, shared hands, a community refusing to let anything die alone.
But ahead: distortion. A conceptual eddy widening in the chalk.
“It followed us,” Estavan whispered.
Eddies don’t follow. They’re apathy made geometric. Yet this one tasted the corridor’s residue like a predator tracing heat.
I stripped my mind to essentials. No diagrams. No mnemonics. Just the idea of the Lantern Belt—mirrors, dust, saffron cloth.
One shape. One pull.
The corridor clung to it, threading us past the eddy’s reach. We cleared.
The archivist reclaimed the birch stone with shaking hands. “Thank you,” they said.
“It did the work,” I replied.
But I felt something else slip—small, but mine.
IV. The Heliodrome Unravels
The Heliodrome arrays should have gleamed. Instead they jittered—angles wrong, mirrors slack, song frayed.
“Comms delayed,” Estavan said. “Drift in local references.”
The corridor released us a hundred meters from Array Two. The station wavered—conceptually misaligned.
“Dockmaster silent,” Estavan said. “We need manual latch.”
We approached with engines whispering. The eddy pulled at the station’s structure—not gravity, but meaning. Doors forgot destinations. Floors forgot to hold.
“Stones,” Sutira ordered.
Estavan dumped reliquaries around the drive. Little suns hummed: markets, vows, twilight harbors.
“Not enough,” he growled. “The eddy wants the corridor’s author.”
Wants me.
Tari stepped forward. “Take the copy. Please.”
His small hands tightened around the box. He was ready to sacrifice his father’s mind.
My hand closed around the illegal stone in my pocket. My last anchor. My last truth.
The station jolted—hard. A clerk stumbled as the floor twitched under her feet.
I broke the seal.
Light unfolded. Not brilliance—intimacy. A doorway in rain. A hand in my hair. A voice saying my name with a softness I had once trusted.
The drive tasted it greedily. I fed it in.
The effect was immediate. Violent. Arrays snapped back into tune. The eddy recoiled. The station remembered itself.
When the drive dimmed, my memory was gone. Not wounded—absent. A door erased from architectural plans.
Sutira caught my elbow. “Easy.”
But her face said what I already knew: this was irreversible.
V. Ledgers and Ghosts
Manual docking was a fight. Sutira guided us like someone stitching torn fabric.
Clerics met us at the hatch, mirrors scorched, voices steady. “You saved the Heliodrome,” one said.
“No,” I said. “The stones did.”
Tari approached, shoulders tense. “My father remembers the cats again,” he said. “He forgot me this morning. He’ll learn me again. He always does.”
He paused. “Did you lose something?”
I searched the blank space inside my mind. I knew something should be there—a shape, a color, a name. But the shelf was bare.
“No,” I said. “I don’t miss anything.”
The truth was colder than the lie.
Sutira confronted me on the catwalk. “You spent too much.”
“I’m upright.”
“You don’t even know your own wounds.”
“Knowing won’t fix them.”
“That isn’t the point.” Her voice cracked in the smallest way. “You have options now. Command-track. A berth here. Anchoring with clerics.”
“Safe,” I said.
“Yes.”
“That’s not who I am.”
“Not anymore,” she said quietly—and regretted it instantly.
VI. Departure
Three days passed—repairs, briefings, sleep thick as dust.
On departure morning, the Canticle waited. Sutira found me with my rig folded neatly on a crate.
“That for us?” she asked.
I set the gear down. “Keep it warm.”
She studied me. “We can requisition you a new anchor. Clean. Blessed. You don’t have to fly empty.”
I shook my head. “Borrowed weight breaks corridors.”
Estavan joined her. He looked at the rig, then at me. “Where do you go without an anchor?”
“Forward,” I said.
I looked at Tari waiting by the hatch. He held his father’s box with both hands, grounded. He had something to lose again.
Sutira extended her hand. I shook it.
“You’ll come back?” she asked.
“If the math holds,” I said.
I walked down the ramp. The station air smelled of ozone and recycled water. It felt real. It felt heavy.
I checked my mind for the old familiar ache, the memory I used to keep for the darkest runs.
Nothing. Just clean, white space.
I was lighter than I’d ever been. It was terrifying.
I kept walking.
