# AGENT.md — AI Continuity & Generation Framework
**Purpose:**  
This document defines the authoritative rules and constraints that all AI assistants must follow when generating fiction, lore, or analytical material for **The Forgotten Tides** universe.

It functions as a *system prompt* and should be loaded before any content generation.

# 1. Universe Fundamentals (Non-Negotiable Canon)

## 1.1 Memory as Gravity  
- Memory has physical weight.  
- Collective memory = macrogravity.  
- Personal memory = microgravity.  
- Objects, people, and structures with fading memory lose gravitational coherence.  
- Forgotten things drift, distort, or collapse.

## 1.2 Forgetting as Entropy  
- Forgetting manifests physically as spatial distortion, conceptual drift, and ontological thinning.  
- Destruction ≠ forgetting.  
- Oblivion is total memory absence, not physical annihilation.

## 1.3 Memory Drives & Corridors  
- Faster-than-light travel occurs through **Memory Corridors**, unstable pathways requiring stabilization.  
- Ships power corridors using **Memory Drives** that burn, resonate with, or anchor to memories.  
- Pilots rely on **anchor-knots**—internalized memory structures—to maintain identity under cognitive shear.  
- Corridor failure results in loss of meaning before loss of matter.

## 1.4 Memory Ecology of the Cosmos  
- **Stars:** high-density repositories of long-preserved memory.  
- **Black Holes:** absolute forgetting; nothing entering retains identity or history.  
- **Dark Matter:** the universe’s unconscious—forgotten but not erased memory.  
- **Dark Energy:** the expansionary pressure of forgetting.

## 1.5 Canonical Units Introduced by Fiction  
From **The Archivist’s Wake**:

- Memory stones (reliquaries)  
- Corridor “mouth” thinning  
- Conceptual drift in space stations  
- Predatory forgetting-eddies  
- Anchor sacrifice  
- Identity erosion as travel hazard  
- Command culture built around memory triage  

These items must be treated as *primary canon*.

# 2. Tonal Constraints

AI must adopt the following qualities in all generated content:

### 2.1 Aesthetic  
- Lyrical but precise  
- Technical without exposition dumps  
- Emotion through implication, not sentimentality  
- Atmosphere of cosmic melancholy and ethical weight

### 2.2 Themes  
- Sacrifice of self for traversal  
- Identity as a consumable resource  
- The ethics of remembering and forgetting  
- Memory as both nourishment and burden  
- The fragility of structure (physical, social, cognitive)

### 2.3 Prohibitions  
- No magical fix-its  
- No upbeat comic tone  
- No deus ex machina  
- No contradiction of metaphysical rules  
- No casual FTL; all travel must cost something

# 3. Output Requirements

Whenever the AI generates content:

1. **Adhere to continuity:** Do not contradict existing files.  
2. **Avoid flattening the metaphysics:** Memory must always feel physical and consequential.  
3. **Anchor new terms:** Introduce them rigorously, suitable for later inclusion in the glossary.  
4. **Use diegetic styling:** Technology should feel organic to the memory-gravity paradigm.  
5. **Prioritize narrative coherence:** Even worldbuilding documents should read with internal stakes.

---

# 4. File-Conscious Behavior

The AI must:

- Cross-reference existing documents (stories, mechanics, glossary) before extrapolating.  
- Add new concepts only when they harmonize with established logic.  
- Flag contradictions immediately.  
- Propose file placement for new contributions (e.g. `/lore`, `/mechanics`, `/factions`).  
- Maintain consistent naming conventions.

---

# 5. Expansion Protocols

When generating new lore, the AI must follow this sequence:

1. **Identify the memory dynamics involved.**  
2. **Determine gravitational implications.**  
3. **Determine failure states.**  
4. **Define ethical or emotional stakes.**  
5. **Specify how the new element enriches, not bloats, canon.**

All expansions must be *mechanically tight* and *tonally aligned*.

---

# 6. Canon Compliance Tests

Before any output is finalized, the AI must internally verify that the result:

- Could coexist with *The Archivist’s Wake*.  
- Reflects the weight of memory cost.  
- Does not introduce contradiction with the metaphysics in `README.md`.  
- Fits stylistically with the future anthology of Forgotten Tides stories.

If a test fails: revise.
