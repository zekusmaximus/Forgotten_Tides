# The Forgotten Tides Universe

**The Forgotten Tides** is a hard-speculative, metaphysical space-opera universe built on a single governing principle:

> **Memory generates gravity. Forgetting dissolves reality.**

Stars act as memory repositories.  
Black holes are wells of absolute oblivion.  
Civilizations rise and collapse according to how tightly they preserve or relinquish what they remember.

Faster-than-light travel occurs through **Memory Corridors**—unstable spacetime channels stabilized by personal or collective memory. Ships traverse them using **Memory Drives** that selectively consume or resonate with memories, creating a continual tension between exploration and identity loss.

The repository houses:

- Canonical fiction set within the universe  
- Worldbuilding documents  
- Physics & metaphysics rulesets  
- Characters, factions, and timelines  
- AI-ready prompts and tooling for expanding the setting  
- Story bibles and style guides ensuring continuity across works  

The first canonical short story in this universe is:

> **[The Archivist’s Wake](./The_Archivists_Wake.md)**  
This story establishes Memory Corridor mechanics, anchor-loss, memory stones, conceptual decay of structures, and the ethical stakes of travel.

## Core Principles of the Universe

1. **Memory as Gravity**  
   The more a thing is remembered—personally or collectively—the more gravitational coherence it has. Forgotten things drift, lighten, or collapse.

2. **Forgetting as Entropy**  
   Regions suffering “conceptual decay” lose definition: floors forget they are floors, stations forget they are structures.

3. **Memory Drives and FTL**  
   Travel requires memory to stabilize spacetime. Pilots sacrifice pieces of themselves (anchors) to prevent corridor collapse.

4. **Artifacts of Memory**  
   - *Memory Stones*: solidified recollections that exert real gravitational force.  
   - *Anchor Knots*: internalized memory-check structures pilots use to maintain identity stability.  
   - *Eddies*: regions of accelerated forgetting, behaving like predatory voids.

5. **Cosmic Memory Ecology**  
   - Stars = preserved collective memory  
   - Black holes = total oblivion  
   - Dark matter = the universe’s unconscious, vast densities of forgotten memory  
   - Dark energy = the expansionary urge to forget

## Repository Vision

This repo is intended to become the **canonical reference implementation** of The Forgotten Tides universe. Documents will evolve across these layers:

/stories – Completed fiction (canonical)
/lore – Worldbuilding, metaphysics, species, factions
/mechanics – Memory physics, travel rules, anchor theory
/factions – Political + cultural structures
/atlas – Cosmography, star systems, regions of memory density
/lexicon – Glossary of in-universe terminology
/agents – AI agent prompts for consistent story/world generation
/design – Maps, diagrams, conceptual art references
/dashboard – Interactive continuity visualization tool


Additional tooling (schema validators, AI assist templates, MD → PDF exporters) will be added as the universe grows.

### 🌐 Continuity Dashboard

An interactive web-based tool for visualizing canonical relationships between entities in the universe. The dashboard reads `REFERENCE_MAP.json` and renders an interactive network graph showing how characters, locations, mechanics, factions, and stories are interconnected.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
npm run dashboard
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/`

See [dashboard/README.md](./dashboard/README.md) for full documentation.

## Contribution Guidelines

Until further notice, contributions are limited to:

- Fiction consistent with core metaphysics  
- Documents that expand world logic without contradicting canon  
- Artifacts that deepen thematic or stylistic coherence

All additions must follow the **Continuity Guardrails** defined in `AGENT.md`.
