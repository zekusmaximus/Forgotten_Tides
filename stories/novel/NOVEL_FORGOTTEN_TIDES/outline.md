# Forgotten Tides — Novel Outline

## Core Premise

Gorgi, a ship technician from an unremarkable mid-planet, takes his first corridor transit to seek better opportunities on Heavonly. What he finds instead: his homeworld is dying, someone is responsible, and his "ordinary" memories may be the only evidence of a crime being erased from existence.

This is the flagship novel of the Forgotten Tides universe, designed as an entry point for readers through a ground-level, working-class perspective on a civilization built on memory.

---

## Story Framework

**Synthesis of Three Approaches:**

1. **The Bleached World (Mystery/Conspiracy)** — Why does Gorgi's mid-planet have floaters when that shouldn't be possible? His homeworld is a test site for memory extraction.

2. **First Passage (Survival)** — Gorgi's first corridor transit goes wrong. His mundane skills and unexpectedly "heavy" childhood memories become crucial.

3. **The Arrival (Political Thriller)** — Gorgi reaches Heavonly as something universe-shaking happens: an assassination connected to "the heaviest thing in the universe."

**Primary Focus:** Political — introducing readers to the vast space opera through street-level intrigue.

## Structure

### Part One: The Passage (~25%)
*Shipboard on the Raoniar*

**Chapter 1: Floaters**
- Opens with Gorgi feeding a floater, lost in childhood memories
- Pod captain Fuin questions him about floaters on his homeworld (unusual for a mid-planet)
- Gorgi's mundane work: certifying landcraft for shipment to "the front"
- Three red indicators on a landcraft's diagnostic — something concealed underneath
- Someone yells "Gorgi!" from behind

**Chapter 2: The Recognition**
- The person is Vess, a woman from his homeworld sector
- She's crying — she can't remember why she left home
- Gorgi tries to comfort her but realizes he can't quite recall certain details either
- Fuin's questions feel less casual in retrospect

**Chapter 3: Thinning**
- The corridor passage experiences a minor instability
- Gorgi briefly "ghosts" — his hands pass through a railing
- His childhood memories of playing floaters with his brothers anchor him
- The ship stabilizes, but passengers who were "light" on memory are shaken
- Vess is worse. She barely remembers her own name.

**Chapter 4: Questions**
- Gorgi investigates the landcraft with red indicators
- Finds a concealed compartment — empty, but with residue
- Fuin appears. Warns him to stay focused on his job.
- Gorgi notices Fuin doesn't seem surprised by what he found

**Chapter 5: Arrival Approach**
- The Raoniar approaches Heavonly
- Overwhelming sensory description of the political hub
- Gorgi tries to contact his brothers — communication blocked
- His homeworld is under "administrative quarantine"
- No explanation given

### Part Two: The Arrival (~35%)
*Heavonly — surface level to lower decks*

**Chapter 6: Heavonly**
- Gorgi disembarks into memory-dense atmosphere (thick, heavy feeling)
- Attempts to find information about the quarantine
- Bureaucratic stonewalling at every turn
- Finds Vess again — she's almost transparent, forgetting herself into oblivion

**Chapter 7: The Mistake**
- A cargo handler named Ketter approaches Gorgi
- Mistakes him for a smuggling contact — demands "the package"
- Gorgi's confusion saves him; Ketter realizes the mistake
- But Ketter reveals: something is being moved off ships from Gorgi's sector
- Memory cargo. Extracted at scale.

**Chapter 8: The Archivist**
- An Archivist novice named Mirin approaches at a food stall
- "Your memory-shadow is unusual. Where are you from?"
- She senses his memories are denser than they should be for an average tech
- Offers to help him understand what's happening — but needs something in return

**Chapter 9: The Assassination**
- News breaks: a key figure in the Lattice Consortium has been killed
- The victim was connected to something called "gravitational primacy research"
- Rumors fly about "the heaviest thing in the universe"
- Security lockdowns across Heavonly
- In the chaos, someone tries to kill Gorgi

**Chapter 10: The Run**
- Ketter saves Gorgi — protecting a potential asset
- They flee into Heavonly's lower decks
- Working-class world: dock workers, food vendors, recyclers
- These people see everything and are seen by no one
- Ketter admits he was hired to intercept the "package" — but his employers are now cleaning house

**Chapter 11: The Network**
- Mirin finds them through Archivist channels
- Together, they begin piecing together the conspiracy
- Gorgi's homeworld is a test site — someone is developing planetary memory extraction
- The floaters were the first sign: memory-void creatures appearing where there shouldn't be enough forgetting

### Part Three: The Conspiracy (~25%)
*Heavonly lower decks, investigation*

**Chapter 12: The Bleaching**
- Mirin explains "The Bleaching" — the historical memory market crash
- It wasn't a crash. It was the first large-scale test of extraction technology.
- Someone is perfecting the process — making it controllable, targetable

**Chapter 13: The Heaviest Thing**
- The assassinated Consortium figure was researching gravitational anomalies
- Discovery: floaters aren't just byproducts of forgetting
- They're being *cultivated* — collected, concentrated
- Enough floaters, gathered from enough bleached worlds, could create something with inverse memory-weight
- "The heaviest thing in the universe" isn't heavy at all — it's absolute *absence*
- A weapon that could make anything forget it exists

**Chapter 14: Vess**
- They find Vess in a memory hospice, barely coherent
- She was a witness — she saw something before leaving their homeworld
- In her fragmented state, she reveals: "They're harvesting the quiet places. Making them quieter."
- Vess fades. Not dead, but forgotten — even by herself.
- Gorgi swears to remember her.

**Chapter 15: The Connection**
- The landcraft Gorgi was certifying weren't going to "the front"
- They were collection vehicles — gathering bleaching byproducts
- The war is a cover for resource extraction on a civilizational scale
- Fuin was assessing whether Gorgi knew anything, whether he was a risk

**Chapter 16: The Choice**
- Gorgi realizes his memories may be evidence
- Not because they're special — because they're *authentic*
- Unaltered records of a world someone is actively erasing
- To prove their authenticity, they'd need to be extracted and verified
- He would lose them forever

### Part Four: The Witness (~15%)
*Climax and resolution*

**Chapter 17: The Plan**
- Gorgi can't save his homeworld alone
- But he can bear witness — ensure the truth survives
- They need to get his testimony to the Canticle Fleets or a senior Archivist order
- Ketter knows a way off-station; Mirin knows who to contact

**Chapter 18: The Extraction**
- Gorgi records a message to his brothers (who may never receive it)
- The extraction is gentle but absolute
- He experiences his childhood one last time: the floater game, his brothers' laughter, his father's hands on a crawler engine, the smell of home
- Then it's gone. He's lighter now. Hollow in places.

**Chapter 19: The Testimony**
- His verified memories are transmitted to multiple Archivist orders
- The conspiracy is exposed — not defeated, but exposed
- Gorgi's homeworld is saved from complete bleaching, but changed
- The larger conspiracy retreats into shadows, regrouping

**Chapter 20: The Tides**
- Gorgi, lighter now, stands in a Heavonly transit hub
- He can never go home — he wouldn't remember it
- But he's made new connections: Ketter, Mirin, the workers who sheltered him
- A Canticle Fleet representative approaches with an offer
- Someone with so little to lose could be useful in dangerous places
- Gorgi looks at a floater drifting past a viewport
- He doesn't remember playing with them as a child
- But something in him recognizes them anyway

**Final image:** The tides of forgetting and remembering, always in motion.

## Key Scenes to Develop

1. **The Floater Feeding** (Chapter 1) — Establishes tone, character, and mystery

## Unresolved Threads (Series Setup)

- What is the ultimate purpose of cultivating floaters?
- Who is behind the conspiracy at its highest levels?
- What is "the heaviest thing in the universe" when completed?
- What happened to Gorgi's homeworld after his testimony?
- What will Gorgi become in service to the Canticle Fleets?

## Tone Notes

This novel should feel different from *The Archivist's Wake*:

| Archivist's Wake | Forgotten Tides |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Elegiac, intimate | Grittier, more propulsive |
| Pilot's perspective | Worker's perspective |
| Internal sacrifice | External conspiracy |
| Quiet heroism | Reluctant witness |
| Reverent | Moments of dark humor |

Both share: emotional gravity, the weight of loss, memory as identity.

When Gorgi loses his memories, it should *hurt* — but the novel earns that hurt through momentum rather than meditation.
