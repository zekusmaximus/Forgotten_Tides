# Forgotten Tides — Development Notes

## Foundational Concept

This novel serves as the **flagship entry point** to the Forgotten Tides universe. Future books will be "in the Forgotten Tides series" and ancillary stories/novellas "in the Forgotten Tides universe."

The title carries weight:
- "Forgotten" — the central threat, the cost, the enemy
- "Tides" — the cyclical nature of memory and forgetting, always in motion
- Together — the vast currents that sweep up ordinary people like Gorgi

---

## The Gorgi Approach

### Why an Everyman?

Gorgi is not a hero. He's not special. He's someone who:
- Happens to be in the wrong place
- Has the wrong (or right) memories
- Gets caught in currents larger than himself

This is intentional. *The Archivist's Wake* gives us the pilot's perspective — the people who pay the intimate cost of memory-driven travel. Gorgi gives us the **deck-level view**: cargo holds, food containers, diagnostic panels, the invisible labor that keeps civilization running.

### What Makes Gorgi Compelling

He's not brave — he's **stubborn**.
He's not clever — he's **methodical**.
He's not special — he's **remembered**.

His voice: dry, observational, self-deprecating. He notices small things but doesn't always understand their significance. The reader often sees danger before he does.

### Gorgi's Background

- Youngest of three brothers, always trying to keep up
- Father was a crawler mechanic (hence Gorgi's technical skills)
- Mother died when he was young — he barely remembers her, and this bothers him
- Left home because his brothers had families; he felt like a third wheel
- Tells himself he's seeking opportunity; really he's running from feeling unnecessary

**His arc:** From someone fleeing his memories to someone fighting to preserve them — and ultimately sacrificing them.

## The Floater Mystery

### Established Canon
Floaters are weightless creatures with no memory. More common on light planets (low gravity = low memory density). Unusual on mid-planets.

### New Development
Gorgi's mid-planet has floaters. Why?

**Answer:** His homeworld is being bleached — memory extracted at planetary scale. The floaters are an early symptom, like canaries in a coal mine. They appear where memory is being drained.

### The Deeper Purpose

Floaters aren't just byproducts. They're being **cultivated**.

Someone is gathering floaters from bleached worlds, concentrating them. The goal: create something with inverse memory-weight — absolute absence made tangible.

**"The heaviest thing in the universe"** is a paradox:
- It has no memory at all
- Therefore it has no gravitational coherence
- But concentrated absence creates a different kind of weight
- A weapon that makes things forget they exist

This is the series-spanning conspiracy that Book 1 introduces but doesn't resolve.

---

## The Assassination

### The Victim
A senior Consortium researcher working on "gravitational primacy" — the study of what happens at the extremes of memory-weight.

They discovered the floater cultivation project. They were killed before they could report it.

### The Connection to Gorgi
The assassination creates chaos on Heavonly. In that chaos, Gorgi becomes visible to the conspiracy — not as a threat, but as a loose end from a test site that needs to be cleaned up.

### Series Implication
The assassination investigation will be a thread that continues into future books. Who ordered it? How high does the conspiracy reach?

## The Bleaching — Historical and Present

### Historical (Canon)
"The Bleaching" is mentioned in MEMORY_ECONOMY.md as a major market crash caused by destabilized memory stones after a harvesting scandal.

### Recontextualized
The Bleaching wasn't a scandal that caused a crash. It was the **first large-scale test** of planetary memory extraction. The crash was cover — a way to explain the sudden influx of unstable memories without revealing their source.

### Present
Gorgi's homeworld is a current test site. The technology has been refined since the Bleaching. It's more controlled now, more targeted. But the goal is the same: harvest memory at scale.

---

## Heavonly as Setting

### Established Canon
- Political hub
- Gateway to three galaxies
- Ten times the population of Gorgi's homeworld
- High memory density

### Developed for This Novel

**Upper Levels:** Gleaming, heavy with memory, where every surface has been remembered for generations. The air feels thick. Politicians, Consortium officials, wealthy traders.

**Lower Decks:** Where the workers live. Dock handlers, food vendors, recyclers, maintenance crews. Less remembered, lighter, but more real in some ways. These people see everything because no one looks at them.

**The Contrast:** Gorgi, coming from a mid-planet, finds the upper levels overwhelming and the lower decks almost familiar. His journey takes him from one to the other.

## Supporting Characters — Detailed

### Vess
- From Gorgi's homeworld sector (not his exact town)
- Left home recently, can't remember why
- Her memory degradation is faster than Gorgi's — she may have been closer to the extraction site
- Represents what Gorgi could become
- Fades into the Forgotten by Act 3 — not dead, but not remembered, even by herself
- Gorgi's promise to remember her gives his sacrifice meaning

### Ketter
- Cargo handler on Heavonly, involved in gray-market smuggling
- Was hired to intercept a "package" from ships coming from Gorgi's sector
- Doesn't know what the package actually is — just following money
- Mistakes Gorgi for his contact, realizes the error
- Becomes an ally when he realizes the people who hired him are now cleaning house
- Street-smart, cynical, but has a code
- Provides thriller energy and knowledge of Heavonly's underworld

### Mirin
- Archivist novice traveling to Heavonly for advanced training
- Has unusual sensitivity to memory-weight (why she notices Gorgi)
- Curious, intellectual, not yet hardened by Archivist politics
- Provides exposition about memory physics without infodumping
- Represents the institutional response — Archivists will investigate, but slowly
- Her arc: from academic curiosity to moral commitment

### Fuin
- Gorgi's pod captain on the Raoniar
- Not a villain — a compromised man making small concessions
- Was told to assess passengers from certain regions, report anomalies
- Didn't know why, didn't ask
- Represents how atrocity happens: ordinary people following instructions
- May appear in future books, carrying guilt

## Thematic Deep Dive

### Memory as Home
Gorgi's journey inverts the hero's journey. Instead of leaving home to find himself, he discovers home was inside him all along (his memories) — and must give it up to save what remains of the physical place.

### The Invisible Working Class
The conspiracy works because no one watches cargo techs. Gorgi survives for the same reason. The novel honors the infrastructure humans: the people who clear floaters, certify landcraft, process recycling. They're not heroes. They're essential.

### The Cost of Bearing Witness
Echoes of Holocaust testimony, whistleblowers, anyone who sacrifices peace to tell uncomfortable truths. Gorgi can't fight the conspiracy. He can only ensure it's known. But knowing costs everything.

### What Makes You *You*
If Gorgi loses his memories of home but gains new ones, is he still Gorgi? The novel sits with this discomfort rather than resolving it. Identity is not static. Memory is not destiny. But loss is real.

## Series Arc Setup

### Book 1 (Forgotten Tides)
- Introduces Gorgi, the memory economy, corridor travel, political factions
- Reveals planetary bleaching as ongoing conspiracy
- Introduces "the heaviest thing in the universe" concept
- Gorgi sacrifices his memories, becomes "light," joins Canticle Fleet operations

### Book 2 (Tentative)
- Gorgi, now useful because he has little to lose, is sent into dangerous situations
- Investigates other bleaching sites
- Discovers the floater cultivation is further along than anyone knew
- Begins rebuilding identity through new experiences and relationships
- The conspiracy strikes back

### Book 3 (Tentative)
- The conspiracy's endgame approaches
- "The heaviest thing" nears completion
- Gorgi, now carrying memories from many worlds (gathered in his travels), becomes unexpectedly important
- His lightness becomes a different kind of weight
- Climax of the trilogy

## Canon Compliance Notes

This novel must comply with established Forgotten Tides canon:

### Memory Physics
- Memory generates gravity/coherence
- Forgetting dissolves structure
- Personal memory is lower mass, stable
- Civic memory is high mass, volatile
- Floaters have zero memory, zero weight

### Corridor Mechanics
- Memory drives burn/resonate memories for travel
- Corridors require attention to maintain
- Thinning occurs when coherence drops
- Pilots bear the greatest cost

### Factions
- Archivist Orders: preservers, regulators (Mirin's people)
- Mnemosyne Lattice Consortium: technocratic controllers (likely conspiracy source)
- Obsidian Synod: worship forgetting (potential chaos agents)
- Canticle Fleets: nomadic responders (Gorgi's future employers)

### Tone
While grittier than *The Archivist's Wake*, this novel must still honor:
- Emotional gravity
- The weight of loss
- Memory as identity
- Consequences that matter

---

## Voice and Style Notes

### Gorgi's POV Characteristics
- Third person limited, close to his experience
- Notices physical details (tech's eye for diagnostics)
- Misses social cues, picks up on mechanical ones
- Dry internal commentary
- Avoids dwelling on emotion until he can't

### Prose Style
- Clean, propulsive sentences for action
- Slower, more textured for emotional beats
- Sensory grounding: what does memory-density feel like? (thick air, heaviness)
- Avoid purple prose — Gorgi wouldn't think that way

### Dialogue
- Working-class vernacular
- Technical jargon used naturally, not explained
- Reader learns through context
- Different registers for different classes (Consortium officials vs dock workers)

---

## Questions to Resolve

1. What is Gorgi's homeworld called? (Suggest: not named until late, emphasizing he's losing it)
2. Exact nature of "the heaviest thing" — how much to reveal in Book 1?
3. How does the Consortium connect to the assassination?
4. What memory does Gorgi lose that hurts most? (The floater game with brothers?)
5. Does Fuin face consequences, or disappear into complicity?

## Research/Reference Touchstones

- **Becky Chambers** (working-class space opera, found family)
- **Firefly** (ground-level crew perspective, lived-in future)
- **The Expanse** (political thriller in space, class dynamics)
- **Blade Runner** (noir atmosphere, identity questions)
- **Children of Time** (big ideas through intimate stories)

The goal: accessible space opera that rewards deeper reading, with a mystery engine driving the plot and emotional stakes making it matter.
