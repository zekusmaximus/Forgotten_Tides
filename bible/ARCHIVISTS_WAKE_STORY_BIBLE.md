# 1. Canonical Timeline of Events

### T0 — Corridor Instability
- A Canticle vessel traverses a Memory Corridor.  
- Corridor begins “puckering”—indicating thinning + conceptual instability.  
- A child passenger (Tari) begins fading into semi-impermanence.  
- Rell stabilizes corridor using illegal zero-anchoring → **burns one anchor**.

### T1 — Galley Aftermath
- Tari recovers physically but holds trauma.  
- Rell hides anchor loss.  
- Sutira and Estavan confront Rell about illegal technique.  
- Heliodrome telemetry received → **conceptual dementia** expanding.

### T2 — Lattice Gap Passage
- Corridor turbulence worse than expected.  
- Tari offers father’s memory copy as stabilizer.  
- Rell refuses — selects small personal memory stone (“First Garden: Birch”).  
- Corridor stabilizes temporarily.  
- An eddy follows corridor residue → establishes new canon: **eddies can track mnemonic wake**.

### T3 — Heliodrome Approach
- Heliodrome arrays jitter; station shows **spatial misalignment**.  
- Local coherence declining toward collapse threshold.  
- Eddies exert pressure on structure.  
- Rell burns his **last forbidden emotional anchor** to re-stabilize the station.

### T4 — Docking + Recovery
- Crew performs manual latch under conceptual drift.  
- Tari reports father re-remembering partial identities.  
- Rell exhibits identity void with stable outward demeanor.  
- Sutira confronts Rell; emotional fracture visible.

### T5 — Departure
- Rell leaves Canticle ship; declines replacement anchor.  
- Sutira and Estavan register grief + fear for his trajectory.  
- Rell chooses to walk forward into a lighter, terrifying self.

# 2. Canonical Characters

## 2.1 Rell (Pilot-Technician)
- 15 remaining anchors (from original 17).  
- One forbidden emotional anchor permanently burned.  
- Demonstrates high corridor-attention sensitivity.  
- Exhibits exceptional stabilization talent.  
- Suffers identity void post-Heliodrome.  
- Current psychological baseline: **functional, coherent, hollowing**.  
- Gravitational imprint reduced (canonically measurable).  

> Red Line: **Rell’s burned anchors can NEVER be restored.**

## 2.2 Sutira (Captain)
- Strong conceptual coherence amplifier.  
- Zero anchors burned.  
- Emotionally bonded to Rell (unspoken).  
- Has command rigidity + deep restraint.  
- High resistance to conceptual drift.

> Red Line: Sutira cannot casually break emotionally; her breakdowns must occur in extremely controlled, constrained contexts.

## 2.3 Estavan (Chief Archivist-Engineer)
- Holds ancestral anchor (rare).  
- Pragmatic ethicist; the conscience of the crew.  
- Never burns anchors lightly.  
- Anger toward Rell’s self-sacrifice is canonical.

> Red Line: Estavan must always behave as a stabilizing ethical axis.

## 2.4 Tari (Archivist Novice)
- Memory-sensitive phenotype.  
- Strong emotional anchors; childhood trauma tied to father’s dementia.  
- Potential future reliquarist or memory-cartographer.  
- Intuitive sense for safe/unsafe memory-stones.

> Red Line: Tari must never be written as naive; he is innocent but perceptive.

# 3. Metaphysics Introduced or Clarified

### 3.1 Corridors Respond to Attention  
> “The corridor responds to attention. When it loses yours, it loses itself.”

Canon rules:
- Attention binds corridor coherence.  
- Pilot disengagement triggers thinning.  
- Attention can anchor materiality of passengers.

### 3.2 Zero-Anchoring  
- Illegal stabilizing technique.  
- Draws directly from pilot’s identity as memory fuel.  
- Guaranteed anchor burn.  
- Used only in emergencies.

### 3.3 Conceptual Dementia (Structures)  
Heliodrome is proof that:
- Stations maintain identity through collective memory.  
- Loss of civic memory → conceptual drift → misaligned architecture → collapse.

This condition cannot spontaneously reverse.

### 3.4 Memory Stones (Reliquaries)  
**Birch Stone Canon:**  
- Personal memories generate warm, stable corridor textures.  
- Civic memories run “hot,” risking overcorrection.

### 3.5 Eddies  
New canon established:
- Can follow corridors through mnemonic residue.  
- Behave like forgetting-attractors.  
- Erase meaning first, matter second.

### 3.6 Anchor Burn Consequence  
When a forbidden emotional anchor is burned:
- permanent identity removal  
- gravitational lightness  
- reduced resistance to future drift  
- long-term psychological hollowness  

Anchors CANNOT regrow, regenerate, or be restored by:
- therapy  
- tech  
- ritual  
- memory stones  
- Solace rites  
- divine or cosmic intervention

This is irrevocable.

# 4. Setting Canon

### 4.1 The Lattice Gap  
- Region of conceptual instability.  
- Corridors naturally thin.  
- Eddy activity high.  

### 4.2 The Heliodrome  
- Major station suffering progressive conceptual dementia.  
- Mirrors forgetting diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s) on civilizational scale.  
- Likely to collapse without intervention.  
- Publicly downplayed; canonically dangerous.

---

# 5. Technology Canon

## 5.1 Memory Drives
Capable of:
- using personal, civic, and reliquary memory  
- converting memory into spatial coherence  
- modulating meaning-density gradients  

Constraints:
- cannot operate without memory input  
- memory expenditure must match corridor load  
- prolonged use depletes crew identity

## 5.2 Sensorium Rings
- Interface pilots with corridor meaning-layer.  
- Transmit mnemonic resonance to navigators.

## 5.3 Reliquary Stones
Classifications:
- personal  
- emotional  
- civic  
- ancestral  
- mixed memory composites (rare)

# 6. Themes (Immutable for Related Stories)

Any story connected to this one must preserve these themes:

### 6.1 Memory as Cost  
Travel or saving others *requires* sacrifice of identity.

### 6.2 Weight of Command  
Leaders cannot avoid the emotional toll of supervising sacrifice.

### 6.3 Irrevocability  
Memory burned is memory gone.  
Identity lost is not recoverable.

### 6.4 Conceptual Fragility  
Reality is dependent on meaning and remembrance.

### 6.5 Quiet Heroism  
Acts of self-sacrifice occur without spectacle, almost privately.

### 6.6 Elegiac Tone  
Stories should feel:
- intimate  
- mournful  
- reverent  
- precise  

Nothing here may be written lightly or comedically.

# 7. Continuity Guardrails (“Red Lines”)

These constraints are binding.

## 7.1 Anchor Rules
- Anchors cannot be restored.  
- Anchor burn must be permanent.  
- Characters cannot have unlimited anchors.

## 7.2 Corridor Rules
- Corridors cannot function without memory input.  
- Attention binds them.  
- Neglect loosens them.  

## 7.3 Rell Rules
- His lost emotional anchor cannot return in any form.  
- Future stories must show ongoing erosion of identity.  
- Rell’s gravitational imprint must remain lighter than pre-burn.

## 7.4 Sutira Rules
- Cannot act impulsively; must maintain controlled emotional charge.  
- Cannot magically heal Rell.

## 7.5 Estavan Rules
- Must maintain ethical clarity → cannot endorse reckless memory expenditure.

## 7.6 Tari Rules
- Cannot become reckless in sacrifice; trauma must shape future caution.

## 7.7 Heliodrome Rules
- Its dementia cannot spontaneously resolve.  
- Any stabilization must require sacrifice and/or memory density injection.

# 8. Expansion Protocol (For Future Stories)

Writers or agents must follow these rules when expanding:

## 8.1 Consistency Test
Does the new material contradict:
- character identity states?  
- anchor counts?  
- metaphysical laws?  
- the Lattice Gap’s behavior?  
- Heliodrome’s dementia?  
- emotional tone?  

If yes → revise.

## 8.2 Consequence Test
Any use of memory to stabilize corridors must have:
- cost  
- consequence  
- erosive psychological impact  

## 8.3 Drift Logic Test
Forgotten structures must fail in:
1. **meaning**  
2. **orientation**  
3. **material integrity**  

In that order.

## 8.4 Tone Test
Stories must use:
- quiet emotional gravity  
- precise language  
- restraint  
- subtle philosophical resonance  

## 8.5 Canon Integration Test
New lore should reflect the metaphysics demonstrated here.

# 9. Notes for Future Arcs

- Rell’s lightness can become thematic throughline: exploration of who he is without the burned memory.  
- Sutira’s grief and restraint will eventually collide.  
- Estavan may confront institutional failure at Heliodrome.  
- Tari’s growth into a reliquarist or corridor-sensitive navigator is promising but must respect trauma arc.
