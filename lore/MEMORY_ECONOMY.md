# The Memory Economy
Exchange, regulation, and exploitation of memory as a resource

Memory is the primary strategic commodity of the galaxy. It determines:

- navigational capability  
- cultural survival  
- regional gravitational stability  
- political influence

# 1. Forms of Memory Currency

## 1.1 Personal Memory  
Low-mass, stable; used for fine navigation.

## 1.2 Emotional Memory  
High-density, highly unstable.  
Burning it risks permanent psychological injury.

## 1.3 Civic Memory  
Nation-scale recollection:
- historical events  
- founding myths  
- rituals  
- widely-shared narratives  

Extremely powerful. Dangerous to use as drive fuel.

## 1.4 Memory Stones (Reliquaries)  
Refined, crystallized memories.  
The primary standard of value across most civilizations.

# 2. Memory Extraction & Refinement

### Ethical Extraction  
Rendering from volunteers for corridor use.

### Coercive Extraction  
Outlawed.  
Produces unstable, damaged stones prone to causing drift.

### Cultural Reservoirs  
Museums, archives, monasteries—these act as gravity stabilizers.

# 3. Memory Markets

Held in:
- drifting bazaar-ships  
- lattice-core exchanges  
- monastery vaults  

Prices fluctuate due to:
- cultural relevance  
- emotional potency  
- mnemonic rarity  

A major crash—“The Bleaching”—occurred when a huge volume of stones simultaneously destabilized after a memory-harvesting scandal.

# 4. Military Applications

## 4.1 Memory Bombs  
Weapons that erase targeted structures from collective recall.

## 4.2 Anchor Strip Mines  
Used to remove the identity of enemy pilots.

## 4.3 Civic Overload Cannons  
Overwhelm an enemy station with contradictory civic memories, inducing conceptual drift.

---

# 5. Ethical Debates

Central question:
> Does memory belong to individuals, cultures, or the universe itself?

Archivist Orders argue: to **culture**.  
Drift Clades argue: to **individuals**.  
Obsidian Synod argues: to **no one**.
