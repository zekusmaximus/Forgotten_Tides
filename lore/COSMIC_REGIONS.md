# Cosmic Regions of The Forgotten Tides

Space is structured not by mass alone, but by **concentrations of memory**.  
Regions of the galaxy vary by mnemonic density, coherence, and forgetting pressure.

---

# 1. The Helios Drift

A corridor-rich region of moderate coherence.

## Features
- Floating city-ships  
- Reliable memory currents  
- Frequent eddy formations  
- Home of Canticle Fleets and several Archivist monasteries

Risk Level: **Medium**

---

# 2. The Lattice Gap

A region undergoing conceptual fracture.

## Features
- Misaligned stations  
- Disrupted corridor harmonics  
- Eddies that “follow” memory scent  
- Cultural memory conflicts amplifying drift

Risk Level: **High**  
Origin of the Heliodrome crisis.

---

# 3. The Remnant Seas

Graveyards of collapsed stars whose memories were forgotten.

## Ecology
- drifting reliquary shards  
- voidborne scavengers  
- memory-scar tissue in spacetime  

Used by researchers seeking pre-sentient memory structures.

Risk Level: **Extreme**

---

# 4. The Mnemosyne Lattice Core

The highest-density memory region in known space.

## Features
- Heavy gravitational pull  
- Ultra-stable corridors  
- Architecture resistant to conceptual drift  
- The Lattice Consortium’s capital

Risk Level: **Low (internal), High (political)**

---

# 5. The Void Regions

Areas stripped of memory entirely.

## Features
- zero coherence  
- no gravitational reference frame  
- no narrative  
- amnesiacs can navigate freely; others risk dissociation

Risk Level: **Absolute**

---

# 6. The Black Horizon

Galactic perimeter where dark energy dominates.

Region of universal forgetting.

## Features
- unstable timeflow  
- memory bleeding  
- black-hole superclustering  
- Obsidian Synod cult territories

Risk Level: **Existential**
