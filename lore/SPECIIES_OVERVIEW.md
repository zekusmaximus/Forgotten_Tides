# Species Overview
Evolution, physiology, and cognition under the memory-gravity paradigm.

Species evolve according to the mnemonic density of their homeworlds. Memory shapes biology as directly as it shapes gravitational fields.

---

# 1. High-Gravity / High-Memory Species

Homeworlds: Dense, ancient, saturated with collective memory.

## Traits
- Thick-boned, muscular, high-density physiology  
- Exceptional autobiographical and generational memory  
- Natural resistance to conceptual drift  
- Cultural traditions lasting millennia  

## Advantages
- Unbreakable continuity  
- Strong gravitational imprint (literal presence felt by others)

## Weaknesses
- Vulnerable to memory overload and “Mnemonic Collapse Syndrome”  
- Difficulty adapting to novelty  
- Prone to ossified, ultra-stable political structures

---

# 2. Mid-Gravity Species (Humans)

Balanced memory ecology.

## Traits
- Memory flexible but not fragile  
- Strong individual variation (e.g., photographic vs. impaired recall)  
- Highly responsive to memory-drive technology  

## Narrative Role
Humans are the “hinge species”:  
capable of stabilizing corridors yet vulnerable enough to suffer from their use.

---

# 3. Low-Gravity / Low-Memory Species (The Drift Clades)

Homeworlds: Light, shifting terrains, easy to forget.

## Traits
- Fluid identities; rapid cultural turnover  
- Bodies adapted for minimal gravitational stresses  
- Memories short-lived unless externally reinforced  

## Advantages
- High adaptability  
- Immune to certain memory predators  
- Ideal for void region exploration

## Weaknesses
- Politically marginalized  
- Prone to societal dissolutions  
- Struggle to maintain technological continuity

# 4. Species with Memory Afflictions

Memory disorders shape gravitational engagement.

### 4.1 Alzheimer’s-Analogous Conditions  
- Individuals lose coherence; localized gravitational thinning  
- Surroundings become unstable  
- Entire families or buildings can drift if memory-loss clusters

### 4.2 Photographic Memory Phenotypes  
- Individuals with enormous gravitational imprint  
- Stabilize environments  
- Risk crushing their social ecosystem with the weight of perfect recall

### 4.3 Amnesiacs  
- “Light” individuals  
- Can move through void regions unhindered  
- Sometimes vanish into drift if anchors are unrecoverable

---

# 5. Voidborne Entities (Non-Sapient)

Creatures evolved in regions lacking coherent memory.

## Traits
- Feed on mnemonic residue  
- Highly sensitive to anchor emissions  
- Immune to physical laws tied to meaning  

They are often mistaken for eddies—but eddies are phenomena, not organisms.
