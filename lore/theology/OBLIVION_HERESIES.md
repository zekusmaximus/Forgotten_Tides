# The Oblivion Heresies
Philosophies and cults that venerate forgetting

Across the settled galaxy, certain doctrines are classified as **Heresies of Dissolution**—belief systems that elevate forgetting over remembrance, often with catastrophic consequences.

These heresies threaten the stability of spacetime itself.

# 1. The Doctrine of Perfect Release

Belief:
> The universe suffers under the weight of memory.  
> To accelerate forgetting is to liberate existence.

Practices:
- voluntary anchor-shedding  
- communal erasure rituals  
- targeted memory sabotage  

Danger:
Destabilizes stations, spreads drift, draws eddies.

# 2. The Black Horizon Mystics

Philosophy:
- Black holes are holy thresholds  
- Oblivion is the true form of enlightenment  
- Existence should return to darkness  

They attempt to:
- guide memory-mass into black holes  
- sabotage reliquary vaults  
- “lighten” populations through ritualized forgetting  

Agents often carry “null stones”: artificial anti-memories that induce local conceptual thinning.

# 3. The Conceptual Ascetics

Belief:
Identity is the source of suffering.  
Erasing the self reduces gravitational entanglement with the world.

Extreme sects aim to:
- reduce their existence to a single coherent memory  
- eventually erase even that  

Some vanish spontaneously—believed to have achieved “Perfect Drift.”

# 4. The Erosion Prophets

Claim to hear the voice of dark energy compelling them to dissolve all meaning.

They infiltrate:
- memory hospices  
- archive monasteries  
- corridor stations  

Their sermons trigger mass forgetting, sometimes causing lethal infrastructure collapse.

# 5. The Heresy of the Endless Corridor

Radical navigants who believe:
> A corridor, left unanchored, can lead beyond spacetime into the realm of pure potential.

They attempt to create corridors with zero memory input, causing catastrophic raveling.

Their last recorded attempt generated a drift sphere 12 AU wide.

# 6. Legal Status

All oblivion heresies are:
- outlawed  
- monitored by Archivist Inquisition branches  
- subject to mandatory memory audits  

Penalty for practicing heresy:
- memory rehabilitation  
- sequestration  
- anchor reconstruction therapy  
- in extreme cases: ethical erasure to prevent further drift

These measures are severe because the risks are cosmic, not merely personal.
