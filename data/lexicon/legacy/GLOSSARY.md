## A

### Anchor
A memory or mental construct used by pilots to maintain selfhood under corridor stress.

### Anchor Burn
Permanent loss of an anchor due to memory-drive operation.

### Anchor Knot
One of a pilot’s structured, internal memory-checkpoints. Numbered.

---

## C

### Civic Memory
Large-scale cultural or institutional memories; powerful but volatile when used for navigation.

### Coherence
Stability of existence generated by the strength of memory.

### Conceptual Drift
Loss of meaning causing physical misalignment in structures or environments.

### Corridor (Memory Corridor)
A spacetime pathway stabilized by memory for FTL traversal.

### Corridor Thinning
A state in which the corridor loses definition; matter becomes semi-nonphysical.

---

## E

### Eddy
A vortical region of predatory forgetting; erases memory before matter.

---

## F

### Forgetting Field
Ambient entropy causing memory erosion.

---

## H

### Heliodrome
A station in *The Archivist’s Wake* undergoing conceptual dementia.

---

## L

### Lattice Shear
Memory misalignment that destabilizes megastructures.

---

## M

### Memory Drive
FTL engine that consumes or resonates with memories to form corridors.

### Memory Stone (Reliquary)
A physical object storing crystallized memory for navigational use.

---

## O

### Oblivion
State of being fully forgotten; zero coherence.

---

## P

### Personal Memory
Individual memories used for small corrections during travel.

---

## R

### Raveling
Corridor destabilization due to insufficient memory density.

---

## S

### Shear (Cognitive/Conceptual)
Disruption of thought or structure due to memory misalignment.

---

## T

### Thinning
Loss of corridor definition; early warning sign of collapse.

---

## Z

### Zero-Anchoring
Illegal technique using the pilot’s self-memory alone as stabilizer.
