# PR Title

## Summary
> Concise description of the change and *why* it’s needed.

## Files Changed
- [ ] `/stories/...`
- [ ] `/bible/ARCHIVISTS_WAKE_STORY_BIBLE.md`
- [ ] `/mechanics/...`
- [ ] `/manuals/PILOT_MANUAL.md`
- [ ] `/lore/...`
- [ ] `/lore/theology/...`
- [ ] `/lexicon/GLOSSARY.md` or `/lexicon/LINK_MAP.md`
- [ ] `/characters/...`
- [ ] Other: `...`

## Canon Impact (select one)
- [ ] **None** — purely editorial, formatting, or link fix
- [ ] **Conforms** — adds content that **strictly** follows existing canon
- [ ] **Canon Note** — proposes a change that *touches* canon (requires maintainer approval)

### If “Canon Note,” explain precisely:
- Affected section(s) of Bible: `...`
- Reason change is necessary: `...`
- How contradictions are avoided/mitigated: `...`

## Red Line Compliance (must pass)
- [ ] Anchors are **never** restored/regenerated  
- [ ] Corridors **always** require memory input; attention binds coherence  
- [ ] Heliodrome dementia is **not** spontaneously resolved  
- [ ] No deus ex machina violating memory=gravity law  
- [ ] Tone: precise, restrained, consequence-driven

## Validation
- [ ] Ran `scripts/validate_links.sh` (or CI link check is green)
- [ ] Ran `scripts/check_canon.sh` (basic Bible smoke tests pass)
- [ ] Cross-checked relevant terms in `/lexicon/LINK_MAP.md`

## References
- Link to relevant sections (Bible/Mechanics/Manual/Theology):
  - `...`

## Reviewer Notes
- Anything reviewers should focus on: `...`
