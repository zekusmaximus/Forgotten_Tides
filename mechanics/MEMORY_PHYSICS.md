# Memory Physics
Core Metaphysics of The Forgotten Tides Universe

**Principle:**  
Memory generates gravity.  
Forgetting dissolves structure.  
Existence is the interplay between remembrance and oblivion.

This document defines the non-negotiable physics underpinning all stories.

# 1. Memory as a Physical Force

## 1.1 Memory → Coherence → Gravity
Memory exerts real gravitational weight:

- Well-remembered objects or beings exhibit strong gravitational coherence.
- Forgotten or partially remembered things lose physical definition.
- Memory is not metaphorical—it is a measurable, manipulable field.

**Forms of memory that interact with gravity:**
- Personal memory (microscale gravitational stabilization)
- Collective memory (macroscale planetary/star stabilization)
- Institutional / cultural memory (stabilizes political structures, stations, megastructures)

# 2. Forgetting as Entropy

## 2.1 Conceptual Decay
Forgetting erodes not only identity but **meaning**.  
Physical consequences appear before material collapse.

Examples:
- Floors “forget” they are floors, losing orientation.
- Doors no longer lead anywhere.
- Stations develop dementia-like spatial incoherence.

Seen explicitly in *The Archivist’s Wake*:
> “The station doesn’t know what a floor is anymore.”

## 2.2 Oblivion  
A fully forgotten object or being enters a state of **zero coherence**—it exerts no gravity and cannot interact with remembered reality.

Oblivion is distinct from death; something can die but remain heavily remembered.

# 3. Cosmic Memory Ecology

## 3.1 Stars — Reservoirs of Memory  
Stars burn with the accumulated memories of civilizations and worlds that orbit them.

Their luminosity correlates with:
- density of preserved memory  
- cultural richness of surrounding systems  
- stability of local spacetime  

## 3.2 Black Holes — Absolute Forgetting  
Black holes consume memory completely:

- No information escapes  
- No identity persists  
- They represent perfect oblivion  

This is the end state for all forgotten existence.

## 3.3 Dark Matter — The Unconscious Archive  
Dark matter is the universe’s forgotten-but-not-erased memory:

- Generates gravitational scaffolding  
- Stores pre-sentient historical memory  
- Interacts indirectly through coherence pressure  

## 3.4 Dark Energy — The Universe’s Urge to Forget  
Dark energy accelerates expansion:

- It is forgetting in motion  
- It pushes existence apart to reduce mnemonic load  
- It represents the cosmic necessity of entropy

# 4. Memory Artifacts

## 4.1 Memory Stones (Reliquaries)
Condensed memory objects with high stability:

- Used in navigation and corridor stabilization  
- Personal memories → warm, textured resonance  
- Civic memories → volatile, high-mass, risk of oversteering  

In *The Archivist’s Wake*, a birch tree memory stabilizes a corridor more safely than a civic memory.

## 4.2 Anchor Knots  
Internal identity-check structures encoded in the mind of trained pilots.

- Function as personal mnemonic gyroscopes  
- Maintain selfhood under cognitive shear  
- Numbered, checkable, losable  

Rell loses one in the opening sequence.

## 4.3 Memory Weight Deformers  
Natural or artificial forces that change local coherence:

- Eddies (predatory forgetting vortices)  
- Drift fields (areas of weakened collective memory)  
- Lattice shear (conceptual misalignment of megastructures)

# 5. The Memory Field Equation (In-Universe Science)
FTL physicists describe the memory-gravity relationship as:

> **Coherence = f(Remembrance, Density, Cultural Reinforcement)**

The stronger the narrative importance of a thing, the more resistant it is to being forgotten—and the tighter its gravitational lock.

# 6. Ethical Boundaries
Because memory *is* mass:

- Stealing memory is theft of existence.  
- Burning memory for travel costs identity.  
- Destruction of memory can destabilize entire regions.

The universe is ethically fragile.
