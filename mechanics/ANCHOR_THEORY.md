# Anchor Theory
Psychocognitive Structures for Surviving Memory-Driven FTL Travel

Anchors are the internal mnemonic constructs pilots use to maintain coherent identity while traversing Memory Corridors.

# 1. Purpose of Anchors

Corridor traversal erodes identity:
- names fade  
- autobiographical continuity slips  
- emotions hollow  
- orientation warps  

Anchors are mental knots tying the self to memory.

# 2. Types of Anchors

### 2.1 Basic Anchors  
Personal facts:
- full name  
- first teacher  
- childhood sensory memories  

### 2.2 Ritual Anchors  
Intentionally reinforced memories used in training.

### 2.3 Emotional Anchors  
High-weight memories (dangerous to use as fuel).

### 2.4 Forbidden Anchors  
Memories central to selfhood:
- core relationships  
- formative trauma  
- identity foundations  

Burning these produces irreversible personality collapse.

Rell burns one of these in *The Archivist’s Wake*.

# 3. Anchor Loss States

## 3.1 Mild  
Loss of a detail or a sensory memory.

## 3.2 Moderate  
Loss of skills, names, or relationships.

## 3.3 Severe  
Discontinuity of self:
- pilot becomes “light”  
- difficulty stabilizing corridors  
- reduced gravitational imprint  

## 3.4 Catastrophic  
Loss of the last memory binding the self.  
Pilot becomes a conceptual ghost—forgotten by the universe.

# 4. Anchor Audits (Pilot Ritual)
Pilots continuously test themselves:

- check each anchor in sequence  
- verify tactile/sensory recall  
- note distortions  
- report decay to chief archivists  

This is required before and after each run.

---

# 5. Zero-Anchoring  
An illegal technique:  
Using the self as the sole stabilizing mass.

Effects:
- nearly perfect corridor stabilization  
- guaranteed anchor burn  
- risk of total personal erasure  

Only done in extreme emergencies.

---

# 6. Sociocultural Implications

Pilots form a caste defined by:
- fragility  
- reverence  
- guilt  
- dependency on archivists  

Anchor theory shapes:
- training academies  
- rituals  
- legal frameworks  
- ethics of memory preservation
