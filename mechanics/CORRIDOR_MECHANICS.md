# Memory Corridor Mechanics
How Faster-Than-Light Travel Functions in The Forgotten Tides

The Memory Corridor is not a tunnel. It is a **mnemonic path** through spacetime, stabilized by meaning, identity, and recollection.

---

# 1. What a Corridor Is

A Corridor is a temporary region of spacetime where:

- Meaning is intensified  
- Gravity becomes mnemonic  
- Travel is possible by navigating through gradients of memory density  

Corridors are unstable because meaning is unstable.

---

# 2. The Role of the Memory Drive

The Memory Drive:

- Converts memory into coherence force  
- Burns or resonates with memories to thicken corridor structure  
- Requires ongoing attention; corridors collapse without cognitive engagement  

Quote from *The Archivist’s Wake*:  
> “The corridor responds to attention. When it loses yours, it loses itself.”

### Drive Inputs

1. **Personal memory**  
   Stable, lower mass, less risk.

2. **Civic memory**  
   High mass, powerful, but dangerous—can overshoot destinations.

3. **Stored memory stones**  
   Tuned memories ideal for precision navigation.

# 3. Pilot Responsibilities

Pilots must:

- Maintain a mental model of the corridor  
- Continually run anchor-knot checks  
- Prevent conceptual drift  
- Decide what memory to sacrifice and when  

This is an emotional, ethical, and cognitive burden.

---

# 4. Corridor States

### 4.1 Stable  
Smooth traversal, minimal sacrifice required.

### 4.2 Thinning  
Corridor loses definition at the edges:
- objects half-real  
- limbs ghosting  
- difficulty gripping physical matter  

### 4.3 Raveling  
The corridor attempts to forget itself.

### 4.4 Collapse  
Pilot loses anchors → corridor shears → ship disperses into conceptual noise → final oblivion.

---

# 5. Failure Phenomena

## 5.1 Eddies (Predatory Forgetting)
Localized forgetting regions drawn to corridor residue.

Characteristics:
- geometric distortion  
- follows attention gradients  
- erases meaning before matter  

## 5.2 Conceptual Shear  
Misalignment between memory layers causing:
- perceptual duplication  
- spatial nausea  
- loss of proper names  

## 5.3 Anchor Burn  
Permanent loss of personal memory used to reinforce corridor stability.

In *The Archivist’s Wake*, Rell loses:
- a knot  
- a personal memory of profound emotional importance  

---

# 6. Travel Classes

### 6.1 Intra-system  
Low cost; personal memory sufficient.

### 6.2 Intra-galactic  
Requires carefully tuned memory stones.

### 6.3 Inter-galactic  
Costs generational or cultural memory—never attempted lightly.

---

# 7. Sociopolitical Implications

Pilots are both essential and vulnerable:
- highly trained  
- revered but pitied  
- gradually hollowed by accumulated losses  

Societies regulate memory-drive use:
- Forbid burning certain classes of memory  
- Require ritual preservation  
- Ban zero-anchoring except in emergency  

---

# 8. Computational Models

Corridor formation depends on:
- memory density gradients  
- cultural coherence vectors  
- personal anchor-tax  

Physicists describe corridors as “narrative tubes” through spacetime—subject to the stories beings tell about themselves and their destinations.
