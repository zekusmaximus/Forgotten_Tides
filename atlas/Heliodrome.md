summary_200: The Heliodrome is a critical Canticle-adjacent station in the Lattice Gap region suffering advanced conceptual dementia. Its arrays jitter, its corridors misremember their own geometry, and its survival depends on continual memory reinforcement and careful corridor triage.

# Heliodrome

The Heliodrome is a station whose structure is failing in slow, uneven steps: corridors forget their purpose, decks lose their alignment, and the station’s song goes off key. It remains habitable only through constant reinforcement by archivists and Canticle support crews, making it both a refuge and a warning of what forgetting does to architecture.
